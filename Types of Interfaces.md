# marker Interfaces

* They are empty interfaces

* they are important
* they are used to provide permission
* for eg. we may want to save data for current state of a program and want to retrieve next time we run the program. 
* to be able to do so we need Serialisation something to be inherited. Thus we use such empty interfaces for this purpose
